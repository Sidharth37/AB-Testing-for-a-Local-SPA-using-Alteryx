# AB-Testing-for-a-Local-SPA-using-Alteryx
<br>
We are part of a team, looking to increase the gross margin for a chain of spas. We have decided to discount the price of facials, to see its effect on the gross margin. Currently the store offers facials at 98.99, and we decide to run 2 promotional campaigns, one of them would lead to a group of stores offering facials at 76.99 and another group offering facials at 87.99.<br><br>

<b>The project compromises of 3 parts</b><br>
1. Select treatment and control unit
2. Prepare & run the test
3. Analyze the result
